## Game time!
Now it's time to take your outline and make a game out of it!

If you haven't already, extract the template folder into a local directory and
rename it "pong".

Open `main.js` and your outline both, pick an image from the images directory
and find a sprite to use as a ball. Then use `game.preload("spritesheetname")`
to load the sprite sheet as a game asset.

Now you can use your outline to write the game! If you get stuck along the way,
ask a mentor for help.

## Resources

If you want to use some different resources for this game or your next one,
check out <http://opengameart.org/>. It has a ton of art that you're completely
free to use in your games.

## Next steps

If you had fun with enchant.js and want to do more with it, check out the
[tutorials on enchant's web site](http://enchantjs.com/tutorial/lets-start-with-enchant-js/).

The San Francisco Coder Dojo had a build your own adventure class much like this
one but using enchant's Map feature as well. You can [check it
