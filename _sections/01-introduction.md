## Techniques Used

In order to make our games, we're going to be using a number of different
programming techniques at different times. We're going to spend a few moments
discussing each technique so you'll recognize them when we need to use them
later. Keep a look out :eyeglasses:!

## Boilierplate

In most programming environments, there's a few things that every program needs
in order to do basic setup. This code that every program needs is often called
"boilerplate". For enchant.js, the library we're using, we need some web
boilerplate, as well as some javascript function calls and callbacks defined to
use the library. We have a basic project skeleton, a project with nothing but
boilerplate, ready for you to use today.

The `index.html` file contains boilerplate for loading enchant's source and
the main game file as well as linking to the source and outline files.

In the `main.js` file, we have to start off by initializing enchant by calling a
function: `enchant();` then we use browser events to make sure our game is only
run once the page finishes loading.

Once we've set up all the programming for our game we wrap up with
`game.start();`.
