Before we can begin creating games, we need to make sure our computer is set up
to play.

## Check your web browser

For this lab, we'll be using the Chrome / Chromium web browser. Firefox and
other HTML5 browsers are great and you can use them for future projects.
However, today we're going to use Chrome so we can all learn together.

Be sure your version of Chrome is up-to-date by going to [chrome://chrome](chrome://chrome) in
your browser and look for the "Chrome is up to date." badge.

As long as you see "up to date" the version number or browser name are not
important.

## Test it out with a sample game

[Download enchant.js sample game](https://github.com/CoderDojoSV/intermediate-browser-games/releases/download/2015-01-23-a/tag.zip)

Download the game using the link above and extract it into a folder on your
computer.

Open the index.html file in Chrome, if the file opens in a different web
browser, copy the url to your system's clipboard, open Chrome, then paste the
url into Chrome.

Play the game a few times. You should be able to move around with the arrow
keys. If not, click into the green area of the screen and try the arrow keys
again. If you're still unable to move, find someone to help you figure out what
the problem is.


Open the Chrome developer tools by pressing F12 on Windows or Linux, or pressing
Command + Alt + i on Mac OS X. The developer tools show a javascript error
console that we'll be checking when our game does something we didn't expect.

## Download enchant.js template project

Enchant.js is a library for making games in your web browser! In order to use
it, we need a local copy. A project template has been packaged up for you.
Download it using the link below.

[Download enchant.js template project](https://github.com/CoderDojoSV/intermediate-browser-games/releases/download/2015-01-23-b/template.zip)

This will save the template project as a zip file on your computer.
You can extract it now or wait until we need it.
