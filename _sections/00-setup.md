Before we can begin creating games, we need to make sure our computer is set up
to play.


## Check your web browser

For this lab, we'll be using the Chrome / Chromium web browser. Firefox and
other HTML5 browsers are great and you can use them for future projects.
However, today we're going to use Chrome so we can all learn together.

Be sure your version of Chrome is up-to-date by going to [chrome://chrome](chrome://chrome) in
your browser and look for the "Chrome is up to date." badge.

As ong as you see "up to date" the version number or browser name are not
important.

## Download enchant.js

Enchant.js is a library for making games in your web browser! In order to use
it, we want to get a local copy.

[Download
enchant.js](https://github.com/uei/enchant.js-builds/archive/v0.8.2-b.zip)

This will save the library as a zip file on your computer with a name that
begins with `enchant.js-builds...`. Open the zip file and copy the contents into
a new project folder.

## Test it out with a sample game
